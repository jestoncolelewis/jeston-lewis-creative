                <h1>Jeston Cole Lewis</h1>

                <p>I grew up in the San Francisco Bay Area where I spent most of my time creating. Being a Waldorf student, my creative tendencies were nurtured throughout my education. I learned guitar and sang from an early age. In my twenties, I developed a fondness for graphic design and photography. </p>
